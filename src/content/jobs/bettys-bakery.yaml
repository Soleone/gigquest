description: Help Betty track her daily bakery sales and calculate profit.

briefing: |
  Oh! Someone responded! Thank goodness...

  I run a small bakery down on Main Street. I'm not very good with computers, but my nephew said I should track my daily numbers.

  I just need help with some simple calculations. Nothing fancy! Just... storing numbers and doing basic math.

  Can you help me?

successMessage: |
  Oh my goodness, thank you so much! This is wonderful!

  Here's your payment. You did such a great job - my friend Mario who runs the pizza shop needs help too. Can I refer you to him?

  *You completed your first gig!*

tasks:
  task-001-store-sales:
    story: |
      I counted today's receipts. We made $450 in sales today.

      I need to write that number down somewhere safe so I don't forget it.
    guide: |
      Beep boop! I'm Chip, your AI coding assistant.

      Betty needs to remember a number. In JavaScript, we use **variables** to store data.

      Use the keyword `let` followed by the name `sales` to create a variable, and assign it the value `450`.

  task-002-update-sales:
    story: |
      Oh dear, I missed a receipt under the register!

      It wasn't $450, it was actually $460.

      Can you fix that number for me?
    guide: |
      Mistakes happen! Since we used `let`, we can change (or 'mutate') the value.

      You don't need to write `let` again (that's only for creating new variables).

      Just type the variable name `sales` and assign it the new value `460`.

  task-003-store-costs:
    story: |
      Great! Now I also need to track my spending.

      Today I spent $180 on ingredients and supplies. Can you write that down too?
    guide: |
      New data means a new variable!

      Create a variable named `costs` using `let` and set it to `180`.

  task-004-calculate-profit:
    story: |
      Perfect! Now here's the important part...

      I need to know my profit. That's just what I made in sales minus what I spent on costs.
    guide: |
      Computers are great at math!

      Create a variable named `profit`.

      Instead of typing the numbers again, you can do math with the variables themselves: `sales - costs`.

  task-005-const-rent:
    story: |
      One last thing! My rent is always the same: $2000. It never changes, month after month.

      Can we put that in the system so it's safe?
    guide: |
      Betty says this number never changes.

      For values that shouldn't change (constants), we use the keyword `const` instead of `let`.

      Declare `rent` using `const` and set it to `2000`.
